# Springboot - AOP

This is a simple project whose main topic is AOP.

AOP is a programing paradigm that allows cross-cutting functionalities.

Instead of having the same code among classes, AOP let us define functionalities that trigger on method execution.

This is useful for monitoring, logging, authentication and permission, for example.

As usual, project architecture follows MVC pattern.
